Tron Kart
=========

This repository holds the work of 4 contributors with the aim to develop a game inspired by the classic Tron game and Mario Kart.

Please note that this project is currently under development. 
Consequently, this repository will contain many files that will serve as tests and sample files.

How to run the program?
-


Just execute the **run.py** script using Python 3.4 (other versions of Python 3 should work as well). 

You can run `run.py` from the `IDLE` or from the terminal. If you want to run it from the terminal, you should first change the file permissions with the following command to make the script executable:

    chmod +x run.py
    
Then you can simply run it using the following command:

    ./run.py
